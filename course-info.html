            <b>Late Days</b> You will be allowed 5 late days to use on homework assignments with a maximum of two per assignment (except for Homework 3, you're not allowed to use late days). The original deadline for an assignment is listed on the course schedule. The "hard deadline" for an assignment occurs 48 hours after the original deadline (the hard deadline for Homework 3 is the same as the original deadline). Assignments submitted after the hard deadline or after all late days have been exhausted automatically will receive a score of 0%.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Exam Cheat-Sheet</b> Exams will be closed-book, but you will be allowed one page back and front (or, I suppose, two one-sided pages) of notes, which can be handwritten or typed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Alternate Exams</b> If you are going to miss an exam for any reason (illness, family emergency, etc.), you must communicate this to the instructors prior to the exam via Piazza.

            <b>LaTeX Extra Credit</b> We strongly recommend typesetting solutions to homework in LaTeX. LaTeX is the standard for typesetting CS/math/etc papers, and will likely come in handy outside CS 161. To encourage you to typeset solutions in LaTeX, we will offer extra credit for typed submissions: 2.5% of the value of the assignment. For first-time LaTeX users, please see the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page for some materials that will help you get started.

            <b>Overview</b> This course will cover the basic approaches and mindsets for analyzing and designing algorithms and data structures. Topics include the following: Worst and average case analysis. Recurrences and asymptotics. Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and selection. Data structures: binary search trees, heaps, hash tables. Algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, randomization. Algorithms for fundamental graph problems: minimum-cost spanning tree, connected components, topological sort, and shortest paths. Possible additional topics: network flow, string searching.
